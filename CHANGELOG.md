## [TwitchMIDI]

## [3.0.0] - 2024-01-12
### Added
- Macro feature: Now you can trigger a set of commands with different timeouts just using a single command or "macro"
- aliases.json has a new section called "macros". Not a breaking change because it is fixed automatically by this update
- New .env flag - SILENCE_MACRO_MESSAGES for new Macro feature. It disables message output for macro commands
- Revamped and extended Config API (for TwitchMIDI+). Now you can:
  - Query what's in the queue
  - Clear the queue
  - Remove items from the queue
  - Save request from the queue with any alias you like
  - Select a favorite request to keep repeating 
- Automatic config file (re)generation and integrity checks. The config files are downloaded and merged from the master branch to fix any compatibility issues while keeping your settings. Updates are now as simple as getting the latest binary!
- Single-instance enforcement through .lock file: Now you can only run one instance of TwitchMIDI at any time to avoid undefined behaviour
- Embedded README.txt inside binary zip. It explains how to install and run TwitchMIDI in basic terms
- Debug profile for VSCode. A launch.json file for easier debugging with VSCode
- New internal queue interface and implementation to improve performance and simplify code
### Changed
- BREAKING CHANGE: /refreshConfig API now works via POST
- Improved clock precision by removing eventlistener-per-request logic. Now there is no event listener for this logic and the request queue is handled by an in-memory queue without nested promises. EventEmitters are not precise enough for music timing.
- Better exit handling - Now it catches unhandled exceptions to improve exit handling and user experience
- Optimized initial loading, now creates batches of promises to await for reduced times
- Code re-organization to better isolate components and domains (Twitch, MIDI, commands, queue...)
- Re-generated config files with proper alphabetical sorting in aliases.json, permissions.json and rewards.json
- Minor refactors for easier translations. The ASCII logo of TwitchMIDI now is saved as a constant
- Minor naming refactors
- Improved setTimeoutPromise with a default case for 0ns
- Updated all dependencies (Twurple.js, i18next, JZZ, PKG...)
- Migrated all code to Node 20, Typescript 5.3 and ESModule
- Replaced NCC with ESBuild for a reduced build time
- Now !fetchdb also regenerates rewards in case there is a change
### Fixed
- Rewards disable bug. Before, it only disabled the current rewards from rewards.json file. If any reward were changed while running TwitchMIDI, it would stay active forever. Now it disables all rewards created by TwitchMIDI (new behaviour) and enables only the ones from rewards.json file (as before)
### Removed
- Max loop queue length. Before it was limited by the EventEmitter to 10 items waiting in queue. Now there is no limit since there are no EventEmitters in use.
- Queue clear rollback function that was unused. Now the logic is simpler
- All config files from final artifact (TwitchMIDI.zip file)
- Unnecessary template files


## [2.7.2] - 2022-09-28
### Fixed
- Callback executed on close to disable rewards and stop MIDI was only applied with rewards mode enabled. MIDI has to stop too with rewards mode disabled
### Changed
- Improved blacklist and whitelist search performance. It was using "find" when an "indexOf" is simpler and can provide faster results

## [2.7.1] - 2022-07-08
### Fixed
- Re-configuration of step 3 (REWARDS_MODE, VIP_REWARDS_MODE, TARGET_CHANNEL, SEND_UNAUTHORIZED_MESSAGE) always re-applied SEND_UNAUTHORIZED_MESSAGE even when properly configured
- Empty .env variable validation
### Changed
- Convert TARGET_CHANNEL to lowercase since all Twitch usernames must be lowercase (the display name can have case sensitivity but does not apply here)

## [2.7.0] - 2022-07-06
### Added
- !addchord update validation. If a chord progression is already saved with the same alias, an error is thrown
- Database "insert" method interface and implementation
### Changed
- !sendchord disabled (only available for broadcaster) by default to avoid confusion with !sendloop
- !removechord default permissions restricted to only Moderators and Broadcaster
- Removed default !sendchord and !removechord rewards
- Lowered price for default !sendloop reward from 100 points to 50 points
- Default value for "SEND_UNAUTHORIZED_MESSAGE" variable changed to false
- Database interface method renames

## [2.6.6] - 2022-07-05
### Fixed
- Typo in spanish text for !midihelp sendcc

## [2.6.5] - 2022-06-28
### Changed
- !addchord now validates the chord progression before adding it

## [2.6.4] - 2022-06-19
### Fixed
- Requests with no arguments. Now requests that require arguments throw an error if those are not provided

## [2.6.3] - 2022-06-18
### Fixed
- Rewards were re-enabled on Config API /refreshConfig regardless if bot is on or off. Now only re-enables them if they were enabled before

## [2.6.2] - 2022-06-10
### Changed
- Minor refactors in barLoopChange event listener, removed unused logic and reduced synchronous code
- Now MIDI is stopped automatically when closing the app

## [2.6.1] - 2022-06-07

### Added
- Troubleshooting section for auth errors

### Changed
- Removed .env from bundle, it is not required and creates confusion

## [2.6.0] - 2022-06-07
### Added
- Incremental setup process. Now only invalid or not configured environment variables are prompted on setup
- Environment variable to toggle showing authorization errors, it always showed them before
- Safe commands now also follow requirements/whitelist/blacklist. "Safe" means they can be requested via chat while requests are paused or with rewards mode on

### Fixed
- .env recreation without removing token JSONs, it gave authentication errors

### Changed
- Now users in whitelist do not need to comply to role restrictions. Makes more sense now

## [2.5.9] - 2022-06-06
### Added
- Automatic rewards disable on close, now closing the app without !midioff deactivates the rewards
- Extended Config API for rewards, now they reload in Twitch too!

## [2.5.8] - 2022-06-04
### Added
- Local REST API to refresh configuration files on demand
- Support for longer response messages (for !cclist, !chordlist, !midihelp, !midicurrentrequest, !midirequestqueue)
### Changed
- Now, if the list of saved chord progressions/cc macros is empty, !chordlist and !cclist respectively don't output a message


## [2.5.7] - 2022-05-31
### Changed
- Now !stoploop allows the current loop to finish and !fullstopmidi stops the sound at the moment.
- Simplified queue forwarding skip conditions

### Fixed
- Trailing space in !settempo and !midiresume messages

### Fixed
- Playing now notification messages repeat in chat when enabling the bot (!midion) several times

## [2.5.4] - 2022-05-19
### Fixed

### Added
- Internacionalization (i18n) and full Spanish translation

## [2.1.3] - 2022-05-13
### Fixed
- !sendchord after !sendloop request. !sendchord is supposed to play once, so it should not disrupt the previous or future !sendloop requests
### Changed
